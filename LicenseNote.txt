The HiGHS source code in highs/ is available under MIT 
license (see LICENSE.TXT).

Some of the code in extern/ is available under other 
similar permissive licenses:
 - SuiteSparse AMD is available under BSD 3-clause license.
 - Metis is available under Apache 2.0 license.

These codes ara needed only when building HiGHS with HiPO 
support (-DHIPO=ON). If this is the case, then the resulting 
HiGHS library and executables are available with Apache 2.0 
license rather than MIT.
